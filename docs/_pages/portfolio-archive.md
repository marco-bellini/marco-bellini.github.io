Dealing with the complexity of real-life projects is essential to really grow as an expert in Data Science and Machine Learning.
There are many excellent online courses for those who want to improve their Data Science skills but nothing beats practice.
Understandably, I cannot write about my work, except for academic publications.


So I am starting a directory about projects of interest from public sources such as the UCI machine learning repository or Kaggle or other sources both as personal portfolio and as a tutorial for best practices.
