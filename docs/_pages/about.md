From the beginning of my career as an expert in the design and development of semiconductors I leveraged mathematical optimization, object-oriented programming, data science and statistics to develop better products, faster and cheaper.


Because of my passion for result-focused innovation, my bag of tools and techniques kept growing, including Deep Neural networks, Bayesian Data Analysis,  Generative Adversarial Networks.


State-of-art tools are game-changing, but even more important are the data analysis approach and strategy that I learned in my work as a project leader. The goal of working with data is to be able to take a meaningful business decision with confidence. 


## About this site

There is a vast number of websites teaching basic data science techniques. This site focuses on a few challenges problems, bases on public datasets, attacked with a realistic approach and state-of-art techniques.


I enjoy sharing my learnings in the hope that they can be useful to others and to keep a measure of my progress.
