This project was used as the capstone project for the IBM Advanced Data Science Specialization Certificate.

## Overview
The dataset comprises time series from different gas sensors and it can be used to study sensors fusion topics.

## Goal
The use case is realizing a machine learning algorithm able to infer accurate air quality information (Benzene concentration) from data collected by an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device. The ground truth data is obtained reference certified analyzer. 
I plan to extend the study when I have time to address detection of faulty sensors and mitigation of missing input signals through sensor fusion techniques.


## Analysis

### [Goal and EDA](/gas_sensor/gas_eda/)
Problem statement and initial data exploration.

### [Basic Neural Network Model](/gas_sensor/gas_model/)
Simple baseline models and first neural network approach.
