## Overview
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. 
The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. 

## Goal
The goal is to train a classifier able to distinguish fraudolent transactions (obviously a very small percentage of total transactions).

## Analysis
