## Conclusions

### Challenges
The main challenge is the overlapping of offers. Without a clean separation of data it would be impossible to draw significant conclusions.
Also, to understand the complexity of the situation, custom visualizations are needed.
Once the problem is understood, analyzing the data is not particularly complex.

### Recommendations
The recommendation for Starbucks would be:
* continue to use offers to increase revenues
* design offers that are non overlapping to improve the predictiviness of the analysis
* consider if there's need to obtain correct age and income information from some customers
* increase the view rate of some offers by combining the social and the web channels

### Possible future work
The best way to formulate an offer for an individual customer would be to use a recommendation engine such as LightFM.
However, it would be important to have offers that are clearly separated in time to be able to correctly assess the participation to offers.
